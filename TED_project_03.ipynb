    "We can see on the first chart that <b>Culture</b> and <b>Buisinnes</b> are highly commented, also part of talks about <b>Innovation</b>.<br>Topics like <b>Animation</b>, <b>Society</b> and <b>Humanity</b> have less comments. Easy to understand why <b>Animation</b> have less comments, but the others are harder to explain, maybe the reason is just less talks at topic generally<br>Looking on the second chart we see that medians of views are far more homogeneous. I find it very illustrative that topics like <b>Animation</b>, <b>Entertainment</b> and <b>Humanity</b> have a lot of views. <b>Animation</b> and <b>Entertainment</b> it's about views, not about comments. Why <b>Humanity</b> is so viewed but no so discussed? Maybe we like to send to each other talks about humanity more, than argue about it in comments. "
