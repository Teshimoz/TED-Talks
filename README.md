<b>Project description:</b><br>
In this project I will explore a dataset of TED conference talks, it's diversity, trends and outliers. Also I'll try to build a model to predict talk's topic by it's transcript and model for talks clusterization.<br>
<br>I want to get answers to the following questions: 
* What are types of events, are they different? 
* Which professions speakers perform there? 
* How talks distributed by topic and duration, by views and comments?
* Which 30 talks have the most views? And more comments? Are they the same? *(mostly no)*
* How talk topic connected to it's popularity?
* How accurate I can predict a talk topic by it's transcript?

Used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly. <br>
In ML part used sklearn (Naive Bayes classifier, SVM), nltk.
